# FirstDegree
Android project that records customer input for band attendance.
First page asks user for initial set up( number of artists and how much each ticket is).
Second page will make text input to create a box for each band/artist based on the number that was input before.
Third page will allow you to place tallies next to each artist so the person at the door is able to record how many customers each artist brought into the event.
Last page will tally up the total profit, deducting fees which are able to be entered, then will show a payout based on a percentage and how many customers each artist brought to the event.
